      ## Vijay Kumar C – SEO Expert in Bangalore&#xA;&#xA;


      As a Google organic SEO traffic consultant and search engine visibility
      specialist for more than a decade, I have helped hundreds of local
      companies and businesses throughout India. An organic listing gets more
      than 10 times the click through rate of ads and has more qualified leads
      and traffic than any other marketing channel.


      > You need an SEO Expert to help you get more traffic from Google if you
      want to increase your business. Google is regarded as the most trustworthy
      search engine. You should consider getting an SEO expert to help you with
      your website so you are on the right side of Google's algorithm.


      Using data-driven and evidence-based techniques, my SEO method is a
      process that compounds over time. In order to formulate a road map for the
      SEO campaign, I reverse engineer the top ranking websites in your field.


      According to me, SEO shouldn't be done by a junior person. Every business
      starts at a different place, so your SEO strategy should be tailored to
      where your business is at in its trajectory. Regardless of strategy, the
      goal is the same - to get more high-quality clients into your business.  A
      site that is highly visible but does not increase your sales is not of any
      value from a marketing perspective.


      You can either call them SEO specialists, SEO heroes, SEO gurus, or SEO
      experts in Bangalore. Vijay Kumar aims to improve your sales and web
      traffic 10 times.

    content: >
      > I specialize in search engine optimization.


      There are so many changes in SEO that you cannot stay on top of it without
      a specialist. Search engine optimization is not something I do on the side
      as a generalist digital marketer. SEO is all that I do. Keeping up to date
      with the latest information and strategies enables me to stay on top of
      the latest developments.


      > I have ranked websites in several industries.


      I have worked with a variety of businesses in multiple industries,
      including doctors, builders, lawyers, and ecommerce stores, and I
      consistently get great rankings for them. My SEO strategies and campaigns
      are focused on profits and quality. You can be sure that your investment
      in my search engine services is taken very seriously and that I focus on
      generating long-term revenue from keywords that will bring you more sales.


      > I provide monthly SEO reports that are easy to understand.


      Get monthly search ranking reports and access to your own live ranking
      dashboard for your business.


      > Contact me at any time.


      If you have questions or concerns about your website or SEO services, you
      can always reach out to me.

      Because I'm an SEO consultant, I don't charge big SEO agency prices
      because I don't have a big team or office. I am a freelance seo expert
      which means I can pass the savings onto you.

  - title: What to Expect For Your Business
    content: >
      For search engine success, I incorporate five key areas into my process.
      In general, an SEO campaign will have these 5 important elements, although
      the amount of each part will differ based on your current situation and
      industry.


      **SEO Competitor Analysis and Keyword Research**


      The keyword research I conduct for your industry is in-depth and I take
      into account the keywords your competitors are using and what keywords you
      should target. Based on this information, I have a solid plan for the rest
      of the campaign.


      **Technical (On Page) Search Engine Optimization**


      My technical audits of your site are conducted using industry leading
      tools. Throughout the site, I will fix all errors and optimize every page
      to make sure that the correct keywords are being targeted. On page SEO is
      key to any campaign's success.


      **Google Local Search Optimization – SEO Bangalore**


      In the case of a specific geographical region, I will ensure your site
      targets this valuable traffic source. By auditing your site's local
      signals, I can ensure it ranks better on Google Maps for localized terms.


      **Link Building (Off Page SEO)**


      SEO is still largely driven by quality backlinks. The right links are
      built by analyzing which backlinks your high ranking competitors have.
      Rankings will be boosted by these links.


      **Content Creation & Optimization Work**


      As your content expert, I will guide your strategy, curate and improve
      existing content, as well as recommend formats.

      the same within the stipulated time.

      ### Why You Need an SEO Expert?


      The SEO expert is the brain of your digital strategy. He/she will study
      your business, your competitors, your needs, and provide direction to
      develop and implement the strategy. Not only this, but the SEO expert will
      also provide regular content analysis and website audit reports, keeping
      your online presence alive and well. The SEO expert will be your eyes and
      ears when it comes to market research. He/she is responsible for making
      sure your business moves in the right direction, is targeting the right
      customers, and is in the game for the long run.


      ### &#xA;How to Choose an SEO Expert in Bangalore?


      Choosing an SEO expert in Bangalore should not be hard. An expert SEO
      analyst will,



      *   Have a comprehensive and impressive portfolio/resume


      *   Have a varied and vast experience


      *   Provide you reports of their past assignments


      *   Give you an honest insight into your market and how they perceive SEO
      strategies


      *   Listen to your pain points and actually understand them


      Once you choose the SEO expert, he/she will analyse your business,
      customers, and competitors and give you an exact picture of what exactly
      your business’ digital strategy is lacking and the ways you can improve
      it. They will focus on your overall digital footprint, rather than stick
      to a few basic tweaks that’ll wither in a few weeks.
