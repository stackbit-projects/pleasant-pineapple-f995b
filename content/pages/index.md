  - title: How to Choose Your Freelance SEO Expert
    content: >
      The hiring of freelancing SEOs or even SEOs in general is not easy. An SEO
      that is performed correctly requires an incredible amount of experience
      and training. You will find that most people come to you thinking they
      know everything there is to know about SEO, but most of the time, they're
      not knowledgeable enough.


      The SEO freelancers need to stay current on search engine algorithms, as
      well as on programs and technical aspects of the industry. Great freelance
      SEO companies have a lot of websites they are currently working on, so if
      you ask them for examples of their work, they will usually be able to
      provide you with examples.


      From keyword research and link building to article marketing, SEO (search
      engine optimization) is a complex approach. You may need to hire several
      people who have experience in one area of SEO rather than trying to find
      just one person with all the skills you require for your website.


      Regardless of what you decide to do, check out examples of SEO work done
      by freelancers. Take a look at their page rank and search engine results
      for specific keywords on some websites they have worked on. Consult the
      website's webmaster to ensure the freelancer did indeed do the work they
      promised. Ensure that your style matches theirs.


      Look at the feedback of the person if you post a project on a freelance
      website. Several positive reviews will prove their experience as a
      freelance SEO company. Nevertheless, if someone can provide verifiable
      samples or references, you may consider them even if they have no
      feedback. In some cases, people with no feedback may be relatively new to
      the site or even to the freelance world, but they have the experience
      necessary to provide you with search engine optimization services.
