      - title: Search Engine Optimization
        content: >
          Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the main area of online marketing.
          There are many ways to promote your business online, but if you want
          your business to be noticed by potential customers, SEO is the answer.
          Search engine optimization deals with the arrangements and rules that
          web pages are submitted to the major search engines, such as Yahoo and
          Google. The search engines determine which submissions are more
          relevant to the keywords being used to search for the particular
          pages. SEO deals with the techniques of increasing the volume and
          quality of site traffic from these engines by optimizing the web page.

      - title: Paid Campaigns
        content: >
          Google's decision to offer AdWords, which is designed for businesses
          to create paid campaigns using targeted keywords, to its users has
          paved the way for social media giants like Facebook to jump into the
          ring, offering their own ad networks to Google AdWords users, all of
          which are benefiting from increased visibility and credibility. To
          compete with such giants as Facebook, and particularly for the highly
          competitive market created by mobile users, it is crucial for Internet
          businesses to adopt effective methods of search engine marketing that
          include paid social media advertising. Although there are alternatives
          available such as third-party ad networks, these are not seen as being
          as effective in the fight against spam, and in fact some have been
          labeled as 'landmine' for those not fully trained in the ways of
          search engine marketing.

      - title: Link Building & Content
        content: >
          For anyone who has ever searched for tips on how to optimize his or
          her website for increased web traffic, one cannot fail to mention link
          building as one of the most important factors. Link building is a
          simple process in which websites create and build links to each other.
          These links are usually created from other websites that want to point
          their site to yours in order to attract you as their 'customer.' The
          more quality links pointing at your site, the higher your site will
          rank in search engine results and therefore increase the traffic to
          your site.
