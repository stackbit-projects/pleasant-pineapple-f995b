          The hiring of freelancing SEOs or even SEOs in general is not easy. An
          SEO that is performed correctly requires an incredible amount of
          experience and training. You will find that most people come to you
          thinking they know everything there is to know about SEO, but most of
          the time, they're not knowledgeable enough.


          The SEO freelancers need to stay current on search engine algorithms,
          as well as on programs and technical aspects of the industry. Great
          freelance SEO companies have a lot of websites they are currently
          working on, so if you ask them for examples of their work, they will
          usually be able to provide you with examples.


          From keyword research and link building to article marketing, SEO
          (search engine optimization) is a complex approach. You may need to
          hire several people who have experience in one area of SEO rather than
          trying to find just one person with all the skills you require for
          your website.


          Regardless of what you decide to do, check out examples of SEO work
          done by freelancers. Take a look at their page rank and search engine
          results for specific keywords on some websites they have worked on.
          Consult the website's webmaster to ensure the freelancer did indeed do
          the work they promised. Ensure that your style matches theirs.


          Look at the feedback of the person if you post a project on a
          freelance website. Several positive reviews will prove their
          experience as a freelance SEO company. Nevertheless, if someone can
          provide verifiable samples or references, you may consider them even
          if they have no feedback. In some cases, people with no feedback may
          be relatively new to the site or even to the freelance world, but they
          have the experience necessary to provide you with search engine
          optimization services.

        content: >
          For anyone who has ever searched for tips on how to optimize his or
          her website for increased web traffic, one cannot fail to mention link
          building as one of the most important factors. Link building is a
          simple process in which websites create and build links to each other.
          These links are usually created from other websites that want to point
          their site to yours in order to attract you as their 'customer.' The
          more quality links pointing at your site, the higher your site will
          rank in search engine results and therefore increase the traffic to
          your site.
