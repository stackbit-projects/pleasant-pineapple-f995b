Hiring an effective digital marketing expert can take a company by storm. Bringing in somebody new to your digital marketing team structure can sometimes result in a new and fresh perspective. It's easy to get wrapped up in the daily work load, and overlook what's really important. A digital marketing consultant has the ability to bring in new ideas, as well as a fresh perspective with the ability to spot areas for improvement in your digital marketing strategy.

The first thing you need to assess when hiring a digital marketing consultant is the digital marketing department in which you are working. What projects are you currently working on? Is there an opportunity to diversify your digital marketing consultant portfolio by hiring somebody with a different skill set? For example, maybe you've been focusing on pay per click advertising campaigns, but you're also considering launching an SEO campaign to improve your site's rankings. Do you have a digital marketing consultant who specializes in search engine optimization, or are you sticking to what you know? You might be better off hiring a digital marketing consultant who can bring a fresh perspective, teach you a new tactic, or expand your digital marketing department.

You might also be wondering how to evaluate the digital marketing consultant you're planning to hire. There are a few major digital marketing assessment tools available online. Start with Google's free Google Analytic tool. This free tool allows you to conduct an analysis of your website's analytics to determine what pages of your site people visit most, how long they spend on each page, how frequently they leave the site, what keywords they used to arrive at your site, and more. Digital marketing experts can use this tool to understand their client's audience and to fine-tune their online advertising campaigns based on these findings. You can save a significant amount of money and increase your company's ROI, by effectively analyzing your digital marketing consultant candidate.

Another digital marketing freelancer's checklist for potential candidates is to ask about the digital marketing consultant's background and experience, and to read his or her portfolio of work. Freelance digital marketing freelancers typically have finished degrees in marketing, and a large number have degrees in finance, accounting, and business administration. Some digital marketing freelancers have only had experience in digital marketing at a lower level.

Another digital marketing expert checklist for digital marketing freelancers is to check out digital marketing consultant applicants' recommendations, and ask for examples of their work. For example, ask for recommendations from digital marketing experts who have worked with businesses that include media companies, agencies, or tech startups. These experts should be able to provide you with portfolios of their work. In addition, digital marketing experts who are working with small businesses should be able to offer examples of smaller digital marketing strategies they have successfully implemented. You want a digital marketing consultant with experience in helping small businesses develop a strong and detailed social media marketing strategy, not just one that's reactive.

The final digital marketing expert checklist step for digital marketing candidates is to make sure you clearly outline your expectations from this digital marketing professional, and how you will pay for his or her services. Your payment process should be fair and transparent, and should be outlined in a contract between you and the digital marketing expert. Digital marketing experts are highly-valued professionals because they help businesses achieve higher visibility and increased web site traffic. However, it is important for digital marketing experts to be aware that many business owners expect more from digital marketing professionals than they are willing to provide. So, in order to get the most value out of your investment, digital marketing experts should be willing to meet each candidate's individual business goals, and create a customized digital marketing plan tailored to those goals.
