Before we dive into understanding what exactly is an SEO friendly URL, let us first understand what is a URL.

A **Uniform Resource Locator**, shortened to URL, is the virtual address given to an online resource on the World Wide Web (WWW). Just like your house has an address to understand where exactly you are located, websites also have addresses that typically provide information about them. Users and search engines access websites using their URLs. You can find the URL in the address bar of the web browser. The URL was developed by the Father of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Internet Engineering Task Force in 1994.

### Structure of a URL

A URL is mainly divided into 3 parts,

Protocol – Domain/Hostname – Path/Filename 

For example: https://www.example.com/test.html

> **Protocol**
>
>  is an identifier that is used to access the resource. In the above example, https is the protocol used for data transfer between the browser and the website.

> **Domain/Hostname**
>
>  is the name of the website you are trying to access and where the resource is located. As shown above, www.example.com is the website you want to browse.

> **Path/Filename**
>
>  is the resource or file you want to access. The path can contain query strings, parameters, and fragments. In the example, the file you want is named test.html.

To summarize the example, you are trying to access the file, “test.html” in the domain “www.example.com” using the protocol “https”.

### What is an SEO-Friendly URL?

Many dynamic websites auto-generate URLs as part of developer coding. This results in the creation of URLs such as http://a.com/ghsgfj=sys?1112255?dfgf#hjhj which is not reader friendly. 

This is a problem, not just for users, but also for machines trying understand what information the URL is trying to push, creating a dilemma when it comes to displaying it as a search result. Take the following example. If the URL above, http://a.com/ghsgfj=sys?1112255?dfgf#hjhj, is created as http://a.com/mobiles/nokia/lumia-phone, it automatically becomes intelligible. 

Through the latter, you can easily tell that the page talks about Lumia Phone under the Nokia category, which in turn comes under the Mobiles category. When information is provided as such, the user and the machine are easily able to understand what the page is about. This is known as an SEO-Friendly URL.

In order to create SEO friendly URLs, categorize your business process first and create URLs for each category and sub-category of services. The category names will become the keywords in your URL which is an added advantage for ranking in search results. Such URLs, that are both reader and search crawlers-friendly, along with keyword in the URL will have a better chance of ranking higher in SERPs with a good clickthrough rate.
