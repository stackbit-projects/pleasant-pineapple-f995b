Are higher search rankings on Google more likely to be achieved with a larger word count? Read on to find out.

An ongoing debate in SEO concerns the length of content and whether it has an impact on rankings. There are claims that Google considers word count as a factor for search results, indicating that high word counts indicate high-quality content.

We should investigate those claims and settle the debate around the importance of word count.

### **The Claim: Length of content affects ranking**

It is believed that having more content than your competitors will help you rank higher in search engine results. According to [SEO experts](https://www.seoexpertbengaluru.com/), a larger word count can assist in increasing your ranking position based on the theory that word count is an indicator of content quality.There are some experts who recommend a specific word count as a "sweet spot" for landing on the first page of Google. These claims lead companies and marketers to believe they must stretch their content to reach a certain word count in order to be competitive. How Content Length Affects Rankings

In the Reddit thread where an SEO asks how to analyze word counts in a SERP, Google's John Mueller says exactly that. After reviewing all the information available, it is clear that word count is not a ranking factor.

> According to him:“Word count is not a ranking factor. Save yourself the trouble.”

According to Mueller, content quality is not determined by word count:

> "Quality is not determined by the number of words. For example, some pages contain many words that don't convey anything. Other times, very few words convey very significant information. If the details are relevant to your content (hopefully), it is up to you to decide."

As another example, Mueller explains that adding more text to a page won't improve it from Google's perspective:

> "Our point of view is that the number of words on a page has no impact on quality or ranking".

Therefore, adding more and more text to a page doesn't make it better."

#### **Summary of My Findings**

It has been confirmed that the word count is not a ranking factor. Google is most concerned with satisfying the user's intent when ranking search results. To convey what a searcher needs to know, it may take 50 words, 100 words, or 1,000 words. It varies based on the query. A short piece of content is more than capable of ranking on the first page if a user seeks a quick answer to a question. Shortening content to fit a word count should not be done.
